seuraavien uhkien tai vaarojen kohtaamista henkilökohtaisessa elämässänne?*\n\nThe following fourteen variables (`question_25_row_1` to `question_25_row_14`) are measurements of risk experiences, all collected as a question battery with the following translated main question: *Have You, in the past 12 months, been engaged with emergency services personnel?*[^01_datapreparation-2]\n\n[^01_datapreparation-2]: Original in Finnish: *Oletteko ollut viimeisen 12 kk aikana tekemisissä pelastushenkilöstön kanssa?*\n\nAll variables listed in @tbl-spss-exported-variables were exported into a `.csv` file using the SPSS function `File > Export > CSV Data...` using default settings and selecting only those variables listed. The file was saved as `emergencyservicesattitudes2023.csv` and was used in subsequent analyses in R.\n\n## Setting up R Environment\n\nWe initialised the R environment with the following packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Clear environment first\nrm(list=ls())\nresetpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)\n\n# Setup directories and libraries\npackages <- c(\n  \"tidyverse\", \"naniar\"\n)\nlapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n [1] \"lubridate\" \"forcats\"   \"stringr\"   \"dplyr\"     \"purrr\"     \"readr\"    \n [7] \"tidyr\"     \"tibble\"    \"ggplot2\"   \"tidyverse\" \"stats\"     \"graphics\" \n[13] \"grDevices\" \"datasets\"  \"utils\"     \"methods\"   \"base\"     \n\n[[2]]\n [1] \"naniar\"    \"lubridate\" \"forcats\"   \"stringr\"   \"dplyr\"     \"purrr\"    \n [7] \"readr\"     \"tidyr\"     \"tibble\"    \"ggplot2\"   \"tidyverse\" \"stats\"    \n[13] \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"datasets\"  \"utils\"     \"methods\"   \"base\"     \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Import into R and Recoding\n\nThe data were then imported into R and saved as a variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- tibble(read.csv2(\"emergencyservicesattitudes2023.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe changed the original coding of the fourteen risk variables to match a logical structure according to @tbl-risk-variables-recode below.\n\n| Original code | Label             | New code  |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| 1             | Likely            | 4         |\n| 2             | Somewhat likely   | 3         |\n| 3             | Somewhat unlikely | 2         |\n| 4             | Unlikely          | 1         |\n| 5             | I cannot say      | *missing* |\n\n: Recoding of risk perception variables {#tbl-risk-variables-recode}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- data %>%\n  dplyr::rename(\n    Weather = question_3_row_1,\n    Traffic = question_3_row_2,\n    Fire = question_3_row_3,\n    Nuclear = question_3_row_4,\n    Work = question_3_row_5,\n    Leisure = question_3_row_6,\n    War = question_3_row_7,\n    Environmental = question_3_row_8,\n    Pandemic = question_3_row_9,\n    Illness = question_3_row_10,\n    Violence = question_3_row_11,\n    Operational = question_3_row_12,\n    Hybrid = question_3_row_13,\n    Polarization = question_3_row_14,\n    Fire_Exp = question_25_row_1,\n    Traffic_Exp = question_25_row_2,\n    Accident_Exp = question_25_row_3,\n    Rescue_Exp = question_25_row_4,\n    Leisure_Exp = question_25_row_5,\n    Work_Exp = question_25_row_6,\n    Illness_Exp = question_25_row_7,\n    Inspection_Exp = question_25_row_8,\n    Education_Exp = question_25_row_9,\n    Event_Exp = question_25_row_10,\n    Internet_Exp = question_25_row_11,\n    Other_Exp = question_25_row_12,\n    No_Experience = question_25_row_13,\n    CannotSay_Exp = question_25_row_14\n  )\n\ndata <- data %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    across(\n      Weather:Polarization,\n      ~case_match(\n        .,\n        1 ~ 4,\n        2 ~ 3,\n        3 ~ 2,\n        4 ~ 1\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\ndata <- data %>%\n  naniar::replace_with_na_all(., condition = ~.x == 5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe did not change the risk experience variables' coding scheme, as it was already suitable for analysis. Risk experiences were coded either as `0` (not selected, i.e., \"no\") or `1` (selected, i.e., \"yes\").\n\nRisk experiences were originally piped in the survey in the following way:\n\n-   The question was a multiple-choice question, with no restrictions on how many choices the respondent made (except for the ones below).\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   If a respondent chose any of the twelve first experiences (question_25_row_1 to question_25_row_12), the final two choices were greyed out and unavailable.\n\n-   If a respondent chose \"I have not been engaged with emergency services personnel\", all other choices became unavailable.\n\n-   If a respondent chose \"I cannot say\", all other choices became unavailable.\n\n-   Thus, the maximum choices were twelve unique emergency services personnel contact experiences.\n\n-   Choosing \"No\" or \"Cannot say\" was exclusive to all other responses.\n\n## Checking Correctness of Data\n\nWe then proceeded to check that all data had been correctly entered and modified. The results are in @tbl-data-summary (the table is very wide!).\n\n\n::: {#tbl-data-summary .cell .column-screen tbl-cap='Summary of all variables after recoding'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::kable(summary(data, digits = 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|   |   Weather  |   Traffic  |     Fire   |   Nuclear  |     Work   |   Leisure  |     War    |Environmental |   Pandemic |   Illness  |   Violence | Operational |    Hybrid  | Polarization |   Fire_Exp   | Traffic_Exp  | Accident_Exp |  Rescue_Exp  | Leisure_Exp  |   Work_Exp  | Illness_Exp |Inspection_Exp |Education_Exp |  Event_Exp   | Internet_Exp |  Other_Exp   |No_Experience |CannotSay_Exp |\n|:--|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------|:--------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|\n|   |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1   |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0   |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0  |Min.   :1.0 |Min.   :1.0   |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.00 |Min.   :0.00 |Min.   :0.000  |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.000 |Min.   :0.00  |Min.   :0.000 |\n|   |1st Qu.:1.0 |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:1.0 |1st Qu.:1   |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:1.0 |1st Qu.:2.0   |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:2.0  |1st Qu.:2.0 |1st Qu.:2.0   |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.00 |1st Qu.:0.00 |1st Qu.:0.000  |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.000 |1st Qu.:0.00  |1st Qu.:0.000 |\n|   |Median :2.0 |Median :3.0 |Median :2.0 |Median :2.0 |Median :2   |Median :3.0 |Median :2.0 |Median :2.0   |Median :3.0 |Median :3.0 |Median :2.0 |Median :3.0  |Median :3.0 |Median :3.0   |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.00 |Median :0.00 |Median :0.000  |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :0.000 |Median :1.00  |Median :0.000 |\n|   |Mean   :2.3 |Mean   :2.7 |Mean   :2.4 |Mean   :1.7 |Mean   :2   |Mean   :2.8 |Mean   :2.1 |Mean   :2.2   |Mean   :2.9 |Mean   :2.8 |Mean   :2.2 |Mean   :2.8  |Mean   :2.9 |Mean   :2.7   |Mean   :0.035 |Mean   :0.034 |Mean   :0.033 |Mean   :0.034 |Mean   :0.054 |Mean   :0.03 |Mean   :0.11 |Mean   :0.038  |Mean   :0.047 |Mean   :0.046 |Mean   :0.029 |Mean   :0.033 |Mean   :0.64  |Mean   :0.023 |\n|   |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:2.0 |3rd Qu.:3   |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0   |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0  |3rd Qu.:4.0 |3rd Qu.:3.0   |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.00 |3rd Qu.:0.00 |3rd Qu.:0.000  |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:0.000 |3rd Qu.:1.00  |3rd Qu.:0.000 |\n|   |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4   |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0   |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0  |Max.   :4.0 |Max.   :4.0   |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.00 |Max.   :1.00 |Max.   :1.000  |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.000 |Max.   :1.00  |Max.   :1.000 |\n|   |NA's   :56  |NA's   :167 |NA's   :150 |NA's   :173 |NA's   :246 |NA's   :103 |NA's   :170 |NA's   :156   |NA's   :90  |NA's   :198 |NA's   :193 |NA's   :105  |NA's   :125 |NA's   :138   |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA           |NA           |NA             |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA            |NA            |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe original data set had no missing values on any variable.
